This game is an online version of the Simon electronic game, with a circular shape and four huge coloured keys in red, green, blue, and yellow. Each key is associated with an electronic sound, which aids the player in memorising the sequence of lighted keys. This memory game will be a hit with you!

Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison created this game. They are both well-known concept artists who are responsible for numerous toy industry best-sellers.

Rules for the Game:

1- At the beginning of the game, one of the 4 keys lights up randomly producing simultaneously a sound associated to the key.

2- The player has to press the same key.

3- Next, the Simon turns back the same light on and a second one, again randomly.

4- The player has to reproduce this chain of light using his memory.

5- And so on... In each round a new key is added to the series and the game becomes all the more difficult as the player's memory is put to the test.

6- If the player doesn't make any mistake, the game goes on, so it is an endless game!

Go ahead and test your Memory :)
All the Best!!!
